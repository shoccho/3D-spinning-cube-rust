A 3D cube redering inside terminal using rust

It could be a lot better if you know the math behind this well.

I don't understand the math behind this very well ðŸ¥², also I am no game developer. I just bodged this together from different videos. You can probably do a lot better if you try this.

 I want to make a library like thingy that would allow me to render things inside terminal. If you are interested in making or can give me some pointers on that,  please let me know
